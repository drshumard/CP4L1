The trajectory details an extensive series of iterative development cycles on a React/FastAPI customer portal. The work began with a minor UI fix—repositioning toast notifications on the login page—and quickly expanded to encompass major feature enhancements and redesigns based on user feedback.

Key workstreams included:
1.  **UI/UX Overhaul:** The login page was completely redesigned to a larger, responsive, split-panel layout inspired by a user-provided image. The automated signup flow was significantly enhanced by extending its duration, adding a persistent informational card to reduce user drop-off, and implementing a circular progress indicator synchronized with the animation stages.
2.  **Feature Implementation:** A Practice Better form was embedded for Step 2 of the user journey, with multiple iterations to achieve a full-page, single-scroll layout. A Bunny.net video was integrated into Step 1, requiring extensive troubleshooting to resolve aspect ratio and autoplay issues.
3.  **Admin Functionality:** Backend capabilities were expanded to include endpoints for promoting a user to admin and deleting users, with corresponding UI elements added to the admin dashboard.
4.  **General Refinements:** The Made in Emergent branding was removed, and a logout button was added to the main steps page for better user navigation.

The development process was highly interactive, with the AI engineer implementing features, receiving precise feedback, and refining the implementation. The most recent task involves addressing browser autoplay restrictions for the Step 1 video by adding a Begin Your Journey button overlay to trigger playback on user interaction.

<product_requirements>
The project is a customer wellness portal built for users who have completed a purchase via a GHL checkout. The core functionality guides users through a sequential 7-step wellness program.

Initial implementation provided user authentication (JWT), a GHL webhook for automated user creation, a multi-step progress page, and a basic admin dashboard.

Development has since evolved to include:
- An automated, animated signup flow that redirects new users directly to their first step.
- A fully redesigned, responsive, and modern login page.
- A 7-step journey where Step 1 features an autoplaying welcome video (from Bunny.net) and Step 2 involves filling out a full-page embedded form from Practice Better.
- An admin dashboard with capabilities to view, reset progress for, and delete users.
- An instructional pop-up modal for complex steps to improve user guidance.
- The overall UX is designed to be modern and professional, using glassmorphism, brand-consistent colors (blue, white, neutrals), and smooth animations (Framer Motion). The application must be fully responsive, with dedicated mobile-optimized layouts.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, Framer Motion (animations), Sonner (toasts).
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Integrations**: GHL Webhook, Practice Better (form embed), Bunny.net (video streaming).
- **State/Persistence**: React state (, ) and  for client-side persistence (e.g., hiding one-time modals).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monolithic repository structure with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.


- ****
    - **Importance**: Handles user authentication.
    - **Summary of Changes**: This file underwent a complete redesign. It was changed from a simple, centered card to a large, full-page, responsive split-layout with a gradient panel on the left and a form on the right, based on a reference image. Custom inline toast notifications were also implemented to appear inside the login card.

- ****
    - **Importance**: Manages the automated onboarding flow for new users.
    - **Summary of Changes**: This file was heavily modified to improve the user experience. The animation sequence timing was extended to 20 seconds. A persistent informational card was added at the top to reassure users during the process, and its layout was fixed to be centered. A circular progress indicator with percentage, synchronized with the animation stages, was implemented in this persistent card. The final redirect was changed from the homepage ('/') to the steps page ('/steps').

- ****
    - **Importance**: The core component for the user's multi-step journey.
    - **Summary of Changes**: This file received numerous updates. It was modified to embed a Practice Better form for Step 2, which involved complex layout adjustments to make it full-page and resolve scrolling issues. A one-time instructional pop-up modal using  was added for Step 2. For Step 1, the video player was updated to use a Bunny.net video, which required significant troubleshooting to fix aspect ratio, sizing, and autoplay issues. A logout button was added to the header.

- ****
    - **Importance**: The main FastAPI application defining all API endpoints and business logic.
    - **Summary of Changes**: New admin-only endpoints were added: a one-time-use route to promote a standard user to an admin () and a route to delete a user ().

- ****
    - **Importance**: The UI for administrators to manage users.
    - **Summary of Changes**: A Delete User button was added to the user list, along with a confirmation prompt and the corresponding  function to call the new backend endpoint.

- ****
    - **Importance**: The entry point HTML file for the React app.
    - **Summary of Changes**: The Made in Emergent static badge and the  script that dynamically injected it were removed to provide an unbranded experience.

- There are no explicitly pending tasks that were discussed but not implemented. The current work is the direct next step from the last user request.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the middle of addressing a final set of refinement requests from the user. The most recent and active task is to solve the Step 1 video autoplay issue, which is blocked by modern browser policies that prevent videos with sound from playing automatically.

The user proposed a solution: since modern browsers block autoplay can we add a card on step 1 that says begin your journey button and that triggers the video to play?.

The AI engineer agreed with this approach and was about to start implementing it. This involves adding an overlay on the Step 1 video player with a Begin Your Journey button. When a user clicks this button, it will trigger the video to start playing, satisfying the browser's requirement for user interaction before playing media with audio.

This work will primarily involve editing  to add state for the overlay's visibility and the button's  handler to control the video player.
